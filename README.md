This is a very rudimentary fullstack app i built for myself to manage my personal finances, and extract some simple stats about my investments.

It tracks my dependency on different fintech providers, (fuck you FTX), the variations of the assets I hold, and some other nerdy stats.

It fits my usecase and could fit yours, but aware that I build this under poor sleep, three double expresso lattes on, and might have some security leaks and bugs. 

DYOR.
